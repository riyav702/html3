        <h2>About Puri Bhaji</h2>
        <p>
          Puri Bhaji is a popular Indian dish consisting of deep-fried bread
          called puri, served with a spiced potato curry known as bhaji. The
          puris are made from a dough of wheat flour, salt, and water, which is
          then rolled into discs and deep-fried until golden brown and crispy.
          The bhaji is made by cooking potatoes with a blend of spices, onions,
          tomatoes, and green chilies to create a flavorful, hearty
          accompaniment. This dish is often enjoyed as a breakfast or brunch
          item in many parts of India.
